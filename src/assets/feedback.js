There is no shortage of heart aching stories, but these marvelous wonderful women invite you to stand with them, celebrate with them, but not cry for them. You have done an amazing, a truly amazing job",

      "But perhaps most refreshing is that the women, even as they talk about men and family, are the heroines of these stories, committing ordinary acts of resistance and finding courage in dire situations \n.  It takes female writers and filmmakers to disrupt the drawn-out narrative of women being and existing in relation to men. We may be daughters, sisters, wives and/or mothers, but the intricacy of life doesn’t cease to exist because of broader political and social issues.  When these women thread their narratives like a tapestry, the result is personal stories that merge into a collective one, all of which many people can relate to, and feel for.",
