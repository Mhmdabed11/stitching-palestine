          Twelve Palestinian women sit before us and talk of their life before
          the Diaspora, of their <strong>memories</strong>, of their
          <strong> lives</strong> and of their<strong> identity</strong>.
          <br /> Their narratives are connected by the enduring thread of the
          ancient art of embroidery.
          <br /> <br /> Twelve resilient, determined and articulate women from
          disparate walks of life: lawyers, artists, housewives, activists,
          architects, and politicians stitch together the story of their
          homeland, of their dispossession, and of their unwavering
          determination that justice will prevail. <br />
          <br /> Through their stories, the individual weaves into the
          collective, yet remaining distinctly personal. Twelve women, twelve
          life-spans and stories from Palestine; a land whose position was fixed
          on the map of the world, but is now embroidered on its face.
